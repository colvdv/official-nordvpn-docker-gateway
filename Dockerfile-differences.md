## The OFFICIAL NordVPN Dockerfile vs. Our Custom Dockerfile
Here are the specific differences between the two `Dockerfile`s broken down by category:

### 1. Package Management & Efficiency
[NordVPN's OFFICIAL Dockerfile](https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20465811527057-How-to-build-the-NordVPN-Docker-image) contains redundancies that increase build time and potential for errors, while [Our Custom Dockerfile](https://github.com/colvdv/nordvpn-docker-gateway/blob/main/Dockerfile) optimizes the environment for networking.
 - **Redundancy:** The OFFICIAL script calls `apt-get install` for the same dependencies twice in a row. Our script consolidates these into a single, clean layer.
 - **Essential Networking Tools:** Our Custom Dockerfile adds `iproute2` and `iptables`. Since NordVPN functions by manipulating network routing and firewall rules, these packages are often required for the VPN client to actually establish a secure tunnel.
 - **Readability:** Our version uses backslashes and indentation to make the dependency list legible, aligning with the excellence of clean code standards.
 
### 2. File System Preparation
A major point of failure for VPNs in Docker is a "stale" PID or socket file from a previous run.
 - **Our Custom Dockerfile's Addition:** `rm -rf /run/nordvpn && mkdir -p /run/nordvpn`
This ensures that any old lock files are cleared and the necessary directory exists before the service attempts to start. The OFFICIAL NordVPN Dockerfile lacks this, which can lead to the service failing to start if the container is restarted.

### 3. Entrypoint Execution (Shell vs. Exec)
How the container starts is the most critical technical difference here.
 - **OFFICIAL Dockerfile (Shell Form):** `ENTRYPOINT /etc/init.d/nordvpn start ...`
This uses "shell form", meaning the command runs as a child of `/bin/sh -c`. This often prevents the container from receiving OS signals (like SIGTERM), making it harder to shut down gracefully.
 - **Our Custom Dockerfile (Exec Form):** `ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", ...]`
This uses "JSON array format" (Exec form). It is the preferred method for ensuring signals are handled correctly and provides more explicit control over the environment.

### 4. Container Persistence (Keep-Alive)
This is the functional difference in how the container behaves after starting.
 - **OFFICIAL NordVPN Dockerfile:** `/bin/bash -c "$@"`
 **Behavior:** Expects a command to be passed or falls back to an interactive bash shell.
 **Use Case:** Designed for interactive use where you want to type commands.
 - **Our Custom Dockerfile:** `while true; do sleep 10 & wait $!; done`
 **Behavior:** Stays alive indefinitely by running a non-blocking wait loop.
 **Use Case:** Designed specifically for a "Service" or "Sidecar" container that provides a persistent network for other containers to route through.
